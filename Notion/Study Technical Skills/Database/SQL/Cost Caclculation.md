- **CPU usage**
- **Disk I/O** (reading from storage)
- **Memory** usage (caching, sorting, etc.)
- **Network I/O** (if data is being sent over the network)

The less of these resources your query consumes, the **faster** the database can return the results. Here's how this works:

### 1. **CPU Efficiency**

Queries that require fewer calculations (like sorting or joining large datasets) will consume less CPU, leading to faster execution. For example, a query that uses indexes to retrieve data is much faster than one that performs complex calculations or comparisons for every row.

### 2. **Disk I/O**

Disk I/O (input/output operations) can be slow compared to CPU operations. Queries that need to scan large amounts of data from disk (like a **full table scan**) are slower because they need to read many pages of data from storage. Optimizing the query to read fewer pages (e.g., by using **indexes** or limiting the result set) can significantly reduce the execution time.

### 3. **Memory Usage**

If the database needs to load large amounts of data into memory (especially for sorting or joining), it can increase the query's cost. If the query fits better into memory (e.g., by selecting fewer rows or using optimized indexes), it will execute faster because less data has to be moved between memory and disk.

### 4. **Network I/O**

In cases where data needs to be transferred over the network (e.g., from the database server to a client application), selecting fewer rows or columns can reduce network load, resulting in faster query execution.

### **Cost-Reduction Techniques and Speed Impact**

1. **Using Indexes**:
    - When a query uses an index, the database can retrieve data without scanning the entire table.
    - This reduces both **disk I/O** and **CPU usage**.
    - Result: The query runs faster.
2. **Avoiding Full Table Scans**:
    - Full table scans read every row in the table, which is slow for large tables.
    - By using indexes, or limiting the scope of the query (`WHERE` conditions, `LIMIT`), you can avoid this costly operation.
    - Result: Faster execution as the database needs to process fewer rows.
3. **Efficient Query Design**:
    - Simplifying your queries (e.g., using specific columns instead of `SELECT *`, avoiding unnecessary `JOIN`s or `SUBQUERIES`) reduces resource consumption.
    - Result: Queries are executed faster since fewer calculations are required.
4. **Use of Caching**:
    - If the same query is run frequently, results can often be **cached**. This eliminates the need to repeatedly fetch data from disk or recompute it.
    - Result: Subsequent executions of the same query are significantly faster.
5. **Optimizing Filtering Conditions (**`**WHERE**`**)**:
    - The more selective the filtering condition, the fewer rows are processed.
    - Using an index on the filtered columns reduces the cost, especially if you avoid leading wildcards (like `%Thương`).
    - Result: Database can return results faster by narrowing down the result set early.
6. **Minimizing Data Retrieved**:
    - Fetch only the data you need (specific columns or a limited number of rows).
    - Result: Less data is transferred over the network, and the query finishes faster.

### Example:

If you run a query with **full table scans**, it might take **seconds** to fetch results because the database has to read every row. But if you add an index on the filtered column, the same query might complete in **milliseconds** because the database can use the index to jump directly to the relevant rows, skipping unnecessary data.

### Conclusion:

- Lower cost means faster query execution, as the database needs to use fewer resources (CPU, disk, memory, network) to complete the query.
- Optimizing queries by using **indexes**, avoiding **full table scans**, and **simplifying** the data being processed will generally reduce the cost and speed up execution.
