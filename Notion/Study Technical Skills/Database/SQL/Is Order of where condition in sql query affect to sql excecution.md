  

The order of conditions in the `WHERE` clause does not affect query execution or performance in SQL. SQL databases have query optimizers that determine the most efficient way to execute a query, regardless of the order in which the conditions are specified in the `WHERE` clause.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Query Optimization**: The SQL optimizer analyzes all conditions in the `WHERE` clause and decides the best order of execution based on factors such as indexes, data distribution, and table statistics.
2. **Index Usage**: If indexes are available on `employeeId` and `isDeleted`, the optimizer will utilize them as needed, regardless of the condition order.
3. **Execution Plan**: The database generates the same execution plan for both queries, assuming no other factors (like optimizer hints) intervene.

However, indexing strategy and query design can still influence performance. For example, creating a composite index that covers both `employeeId` and `isDeleted` could improve performance, as it might allow the query to use index-only scans.
