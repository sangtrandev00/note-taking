Notes from the author (Gergely Orosz: previously engineering manager at Uber):

Keeping a “work log” is a great idea for software engineers. Every week, record key work items you’ve worked on: key code changes, code reviews, design documents, discussions and planning, helping out others, postmortems and anything else that took time, and has impact. Julia Evans calls this [a brag document](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/), and it has so many benefits: not just for performance reviews, but also for yourself feeling better on just how many things you did!

Feel free to use this document as an inspiration.
