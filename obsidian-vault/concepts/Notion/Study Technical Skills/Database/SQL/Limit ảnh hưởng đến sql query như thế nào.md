  

The `LIMIT` clause speeds up your query because it reduces the number of rows the database engine needs to retrieve, sort, or return. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why this is generally faster:

1. **Reduced Data Retrieval**: When you add `LIMIT 10`, the database only needs to fetch 10 rows, rather than all the rows in the `property_detail` table. Without `LIMIT`, the database retrieves every row, which takes more time as the number of rows increases.
2. **Optimized Execution Plan**: Many databases optimize the execution plan when they see a `LIMIT` clause, focusing on quickly fetching the first few rows rather than scanning the entire table.
3. **Less Memory Usage**: With fewer rows to handle, the database engine uses less memory, especially if the table is large.
4. **Minimal I/O Operations**: When the query accesses a smaller subset of data, fewer read operations are performed on the disk, significantly reducing I/O time, which can be a bottleneck for large datasets.

For large tables, these efficiencies make a big difference in performance.
