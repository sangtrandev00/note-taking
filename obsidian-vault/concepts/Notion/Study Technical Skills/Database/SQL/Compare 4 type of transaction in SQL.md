|                                        |                |                         |                  |                             |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Isolation Level**                    | **Dirty Read** | **Non-Repeatable Read** | **Phantom Read** | **Write Blocking**          |
| **READ UNCOMMITTED**                   | Yes            | Yes                     | Yes              | No (writes are not blocked) |
| **READ COMMITTED**                     | No             | Yes                     | Yes              | Yes (writes are blocked)    |
| **REPEATABLE READ (DEFAULT IN MYSQL)** | No             | No                      | Yes              | Yes (writes are blocked)    |
| **SERIALIZABLE**                       | No             | No                      | No               | Yes (writes are blocked)    |

### Explanation of Terms:

- **Dirty Read**: A transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction but not yet committed. If the other transaction rolls back, the data read by the first transaction becomes invalid.
- **Non-Repeatable Read**: A transaction reads the same row twice and gets different data each time because another transaction has modified the data and committed the changes in between the two reads.
- **Phantom Read**: A transaction reads a set of rows that match a condition, and then another transaction inserts or deletes rows that would have matched the condition. If the original transaction re-executes the query, it gets a different set of rows.
- **Write Blocking**: Refers to whether a transaction's write operations (insert, update, delete) can be blocked by other transactions.

### Detailed Descriptions:

1. **READ UNCOMMITTED**:
    - **Dirty Read**: Allowed. Can read uncommitted changes from other transactions.
    - **Non-Repeatable Read**: Allowed. Can read the same row and get different results if another transaction modifies and commits between reads.
    - **Phantom Read**: Allowed. Can see different sets of rows if another transaction inserts/deletes rows matching the condition between reads.
    - **Write Blocking**: Does not block writes. Transactions can read and write without waiting for other transactions to complete.
2. **READ COMMITTED**:
    - **Dirty Read**: Not allowed. Only reads committed changes.
    - **Non-Repeatable Read**: Allowed. Can read the same row and get different results if another transaction commits changes between reads.
    - **Phantom Read**: Allowed. Can see different sets of rows if another transaction inserts/deletes rows matching the condition between reads.
    - **Write Blocking**: Writes are blocked if another transaction is modifying the same data. Ensures that data being read is committed.
3. **REPEATABLE READ**:
    - **Dirty Read**: Not allowed. Only reads committed changes.
    - **Non-Repeatable Read**: Not allowed. Ensures that repeated reads of the same row return the same data.
    - **Phantom Read**: Allowed. Can see different sets of rows if another transaction inserts/deletes rows matching the condition between reads.
    - **Write Blocking**: Writes are blocked if another transaction is modifying the same data. Ensures consistent reads within the transaction.
4. **SERIALIZABLE**:
    - **Dirty Read**: Not allowed. Only reads committed changes.
    - **Non-Repeatable Read**: Not allowed. Ensures that repeated reads of the same row return the same data.
    - **Phantom Read**: Not allowed. Ensures that the set of rows returned by a query remains consistent within the transaction.
    - **Write Blocking**: Writes are blocked if another transaction is modifying the same data. Provides the highest level of isolation by ensuring that transactions are executed in a way that produces the same result as if they were executed sequentially.

### Usage Context:

- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Useful for scenarios where the cost of locking data is too high, and the application can tolerate dirty reads. For example, when generating reports where exact accuracy is not critical.
- **READ COMMITTED**: Common default isolation level in many databases. Provides a balance between consistency and concurrency. Suitable for most typical business applications.
- **REPEATABLE READ**: Used when it is important to have consistent reads during a transaction, such as in financial applications where the same data needs to be read multiple times with the assurance that it hasn't changed.
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Provides the highest level of isolation and ensures complete consistency. Suitable for scenarios where accuracy is critical and the cost of reduced concurrency is acceptable, such as in complex financial transactions or critical inventory management systems.
