# Why Bulk Inserts Outperform Individual Inserts

Bulk inserts (inserting multiple rows at once) significantly outperform individual inserts for several technical reasons:

## Database Engine Efficiency

1. **Reduced Network Roundtrips**
    - Each database call incurs network latency
    - 1,000 individual inserts = 1,000 network roundtrips
    - 1 bulk insert with 1,000 rows = just 1 network roundtrip
2. **Query Parsing & Execution Plan**
    - The database only needs to parse the SQL statement once
    - The execution plan is created and optimized once instead of thousands of times
3. **Transaction Log Optimization**
    - Fewer transaction log entries and writes
    - Log flushes can be batched more efficiently
4. **Reduced Lock Contention**
    - Acquiring and releasing locks for each row is expensive
    - Bulk operations can optimize lock management

## Resource Utilization

5. **Index Maintenance**
    - Indexes are updated more efficiently in bulk
    - For individual inserts, each one requires separate index operations
6. **Memory Utilization**
    - The buffer pool can be used more efficiently
    - Better cache utilization for related operations
7. **Reduced CPU Overhead**
    - Less context switching between SQL statement executions
    - More efficient internal memory allocation

## Real-World Performance Impact

In real-world scenarios, the performance difference can be dramatic:

Copy

`Operation          | Time for 10,000 rows -------------------|------------------ Individual INSERTs | 100-300 seconds Bulk INSERT        | 1-5 seconds`

This is why data loading utilities and ETL processes almost always use bulk operations rather than row-by-row processing whenever possible
