Let me break down these two commands:

1. `chmod 400 /Users/trannhatsang/Downloads/express-api-server-key-pair.pem`

- `chmod` = Change Mode (file permissions)
- `400` = Permission setting where:
    - `4` = Read permission for the owner
    - `0` = No permissions for group
    - `0` = No permissions for others
- This is a security requirement by SSH - your key file must be protected and only readable by you

2. `ssh -i "/Users/trannhatsang/Downloads/express-api-server-key-pair.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-public-dns`

- `ssh` = Secure Shell (protocol for securely connecting to remote servers)
- `-i` = Identity file (specifies which key file to use)
- `"/Users/trannhatsang/Downloads/express-api-server-key-pair.pem"` = Path to your private key file
- `ec2-user` = Default username for Amazon Linux instances
- `your-ec2-public-dns` = Your EC2 instance's public address (in your case it would be `18.139.255.107`)

It's like having a special key (the .pem file) to enter a secure building (your EC2 instance):

- First command (`chmod`) makes sure only you can use the key
- Second command (`ssh`) uses that key to connect to your server

In your specific case, the second command should be:

bash

Copy

`ssh -i "/Users/trannhatsang/Downloads/express-api-server-key-pair.pem" ec2-user@18`
