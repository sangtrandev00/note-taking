To publish a markdown note from your obsidian-vault folder to your Jekyll static website, here's what you should do:

Step-by-Step Process:

1. Copy the markdown file to Jekyll's _posts folder
```bash
cp obsidian-vault/your-note.md jekyll-blog/_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-your-note.md
```

2. Add Jekyll front matter to the post
Open the copied file and add YAML front matter at the top:
```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Post Title"
date: 2025-06-07
categories: [category1, category2]
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---

```
2. Fix any Obsidian-specific syntax
•  Convert [[Internal Links]] to Jekyll-compatible links
•  Update image paths to point to your Jekyll assets folder
•  Remove or convert any Obsidian plugins syntax

3. The post will automatically appear on your website
Since Jekyll is running with auto-regeneration, your new post will automatically appear at http://127.0.0.1:4002/ within a few seconds.

Pro Tips:

•  File naming: Jekyll posts must follow the format YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
•  Images: Your obsidian-vault images are already linked via the symlink you have
•  Automation: You could create a script to automate this process
•  Preview: Always check http://127.0.0.1:4002/ to see how your post looks before publishing
