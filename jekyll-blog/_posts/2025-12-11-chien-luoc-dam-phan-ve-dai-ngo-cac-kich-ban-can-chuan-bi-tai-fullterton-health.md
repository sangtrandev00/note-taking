## 1. **Frame the Offer Positively**

- Mention the offer as a testament to your skills and market demand, but don’t use it as a direct bargaining chip. Instead, position it as validation of your worth.  
    Example:  
    _"I was recently offered a position at $550 per month by another company, which reinforced the value of my technical and communication skills. However, I am particularly excited about the opportunity at Fullerton Health because of its reputation and alignment with my long-term career goals."_

## 2. **Emphasize the Fit**

- Show enthusiasm for Fullerton Health specifically and explain why you’re prioritizing them despite the existing offer.  
    Example:  
    _"While I appreciate the other offer, I see Fullerton Health as a better match for my skills and aspirations. The role aligns more closely with my technical expertise in Node.js and my ability to work effectively in English-speaking environments."_


## 3. When be counter for my expectation

If they offer closer to $650, or 600, you can respond:  
_"I appreciate that offer, and I’d like to point out that I’ve demonstrated strong technical and communication skills that set me apart. I would feel more comfortable at $700 to align with the market value and the responsibilities of this role."_
