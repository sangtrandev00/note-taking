### **1. Concept Flow**

The recruiter mentioned a **"concept flow"** which typically means:

- Understanding a specific concept (e.g., a framework, algorithm, or solution).
- Explaining it in a structured, **step-by-step flow** like a diagram or clear explanation.

**Example topics:**

- Solving a **problem or algorithm** and presenting the solution as a flowchart or steps.
- Designing a feature or module for a system and explaining it step by step.

**How to Prepare:**

- **Review data structures & algorithms**: Know how to approach common problems (sorting, searching, etc.).
- Practice explaining your **thought process** clearly:
    - Use **flowcharts** or step-by-step outlines.
    - Example: _"If asked to solve a problem using recursion, I would break it into steps: base case, recursive case, and structure the function flow."_
- Tools to use: Draw flow diagrams on **paper**, or practice using tools like draw.io.

### **2. Technical Test or Code Challenges**

The recruiter asked if you're okay with tests on "concept flow using a **board**," which means:

- **Whiteboard or virtual coding interview**.
- You may be tested on your coding skills or concepts without access to a code editor.

**Possible Topics:**

1. **Core JavaScript/Node.js**:
    
    - Asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await).
    - Event loop and execution context.
    - Handling errors in Node.js.
    - CRUD operations and database design.
2. **Algorithms/Problem Solving**:
    
    - Array and string manipulations.
    - Grouping, sorting, and filtering data.
    - Time and space complexity analysis.

1. **System Design/Architecture** (basic level):
    
    - Designing RESTful APIs.
    - Explaining modules in your NestJS app or database schema design.
