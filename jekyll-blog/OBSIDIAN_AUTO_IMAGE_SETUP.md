# 🖼️ Obsidian Auto Image Organization Setup

## ✅ Configuration Complete!

Your Obsidian is now configured to automatically save all pasted images to `assets/images/obsidian/`.

## 🔧 Current Configuration

The following settings are applied in `.obsidian/app.json`:

```json
{
  "attachmentFolderPath": "assets/images/obsidian",
  "useMarkdownLinks": true,
  "newLinkFormat": "relative",
  "attachmentFolderLocation": "inAttachmentFolder"
}
```

### What Each Setting Does:

- **`attachmentFolderPath`**: Specifies where images will be saved
- **`useMarkdownLinks`**: Uses `![](path)` format instead of `[[path]]`
- **`newLinkFormat: relative`**: Creates relative paths (better for Jekyll)
- **`attachmentFolderLocation`**: Ensures images go to specified folder

## 🚀 How to Activate

### Step 1: Restart Obsidian
1. **Close Obsidian completely**
2. **Reopen Obsidian**
3. **Open your NoteTaking vault**

### Step 2: Verify Settings in Obsidian
1. Go to **Settings** (⚙️ icon)
2. Navigate to **Files & Links**
3. Verify these settings:
   - **Default location for new attachments**: `In the folder specified below`
   - **Attachment folder path**: `assets/images/obsidian`
   - **Use [[Wikilinks]]**: `OFF` (unchecked)
   - **New link format**: `Relative path to file`

## 🧪 Test the Setup

### Method 1: Copy & Paste
1. **Copy any image** from your browser or screenshot
2. **Open any markdown note** in Obsidian
3. **Paste** (Cmd+V on Mac)
4. **Check**: Image should appear in `assets/images/obsidian/`

### Method 2: Drag & Drop
1. **Drag an image file** into Obsidian
2. **Drop it** into any note
3. **Check**: Image should be copied to `assets/images/obsidian/`

## ✅ Expected Results

### Image Location:
```
assets/images/obsidian/
└── Pasted image 20250607145830.png  # ← New image here!
```

### Link Format in Note:
```markdown
![](assets/images/obsidian/Pasted%20image%2020250607145830.png)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Images Still Go to Root Directory:

1. **Check Obsidian Settings**:
   - Settings → Files & Links
   - Ensure "Attachment folder path" is set to `assets/images/obsidian`

2. **Manual Override**:
   ```json
   // In .obsidian/app.json, add:
   "attachmentFolderPath": "assets/images/obsidian",
   "newFileLocation": "folder"
   ```

3. **Restart Obsidian** after any changes

### If Links Don't Work in Jekyll:

1. **Check link format** - should be relative paths
2. **Verify Jekyll can access** `assets/` folder
3. **Test** with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## 🎯 Advanced Options

### Date-Based Organization:
If you want images organized by date, change in `.obsidian/app.json`:
```json
{
  "attachmentFolderPath": "assets/images/obsidian/{{date:YYYY-MM}}"
}
```

### Topic-Based Organization:
For topic-based folders:
```json
{
  "attachmentFolderPath": "assets/images/obsidian/{{title}}"
}
```
