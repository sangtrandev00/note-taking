### **1. Questions About Technical Skills**

#### Example Questions:

- _"Can you walk us through a challenging project you worked on recently? How did you solve the technical problems?"_
- _"How do you ensure the scalability and performance of backend services?"_
- _"What’s your experience with RESTful API design and development?"_

#### How to Answer:

- Use the **STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** to structure your response:
    - **Situation:** Briefly describe the project or context.
    - **Task:** Outline your role and objectives.
    - **Action:** Explain the steps you took, focusing on technical solutions.
    - **Result:** Highlight the positive outcomes (e.g., performance improvements, successful deployment).
- Example: _"In a recent project, I was tasked with improving the performance of a Node.js API that supported thousands of users. I identified bottlenecks using performance profiling tools and implemented caching with Redis. As a result, response times improved by 40%, and user complaints about delays dropped significantly."_

### **2. Problem-Solving and Coding Challenges**

#### Example Questions:

- _"How would you handle a situation where the database query is too slow?"_
- _"Write a function to reverse a linked list or solve a specific algorithmic problem."_

#### How to Answer:

- For theoretical questions, discuss a structured approach:
    
    - **Understand:** Clarify the problem and constraints.
    - **Plan:** Share your high-level approach.
    - **Execute:** Walk through your solution step-by-step, ensuring clarity.
    - **Validate:** Test edge cases and explain your thought process.
- For coding challenges:
    
    - Speak as you code, explaining your logic.
    - Ask questions if something is unclear.
    - Optimize your solution if time permits but don’t dwell excessively.

### **3. Teamwork and Communication**

#### Example Questions:

- _"How do you handle disagreements with other developers on the team?"_
- _"Can you give an example of a time when you had to explain a complex technical concept to a non-technical stakeholder?"_

#### How to Answer:

- Emphasize your collaborative mindset and ability to adapt.
    
- Example: _"When I faced disagreements over implementation strategies, I ensured that all opinions were heard and suggested comparing approaches based on metrics like performance or maintainability. This fostered mutual respect and led to better decisions."_
    
- For communication:
    
    - Simplify technical jargon.
    - Example: _"I often use analogies or visuals to explain technical concepts. For instance, I once compared a database index to a book's table of contents to explain its function to a non-technical colleague."_

### **4. Understanding Their Infrastructure**

#### Example Questions:

- _"What is your experience with the tools and technologies we use, such as Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS?"_
- _"Have you ever deployed a backend system to production? What challenges did you face?"_

#### How to Answer:

- Relate your experience directly to their stack.
- If unfamiliar with a tool, emphasize your quick learning abilities.
- Example: _"While I haven’t used AWS Lambda extensively, I’ve worked with similar serverless architectures in Firebase Functions. I’m confident I can quickly adapt to your setup."_

### **5. Hypothetical Scenarios**

#### Example Questions:

- _"What would you do if you discovered a critical bug right before a product release?"_
- _"How would you ensure code quality when working under tight deadlines?"_

#### How to Answer:

- Demonstrate a balance between technical rigor and practical decision-making.
- Example: _"If I found a critical bug, I’d first assess its impact on functionality and security. If it’s severe, I’d prioritize fixing it immediately while communicating transparently with stakeholders about the delay. If it’s minor, I’d log it and schedule a patch post-release."_

---

### **6. Long-Term Thinking**

#### Example Questions:

- _"Where do you see yourself in five years?"_
- _"How do you stay updated with the latest technologies?"_

#### How to Answer:

- Align your goals with the company’s vision.
- Example: _"In five years, I see myself taking on more leadership responsibilities while continuing to deepen my expertise in backend systems. I’m particularly excited about contributing to innovative healthcare solutions here at Fullerton Health."_

### Handling Difficult Questions

- **If You Don’t Know the Answer:**  
    _"I’m not familiar with that specific concept, but I would approach it by researching X and experimenting with Y to find a solution."_
- **If You Need Time to Think:**  
    _"That’s an interesting question. Let me take a moment to organize my thoughts."_
